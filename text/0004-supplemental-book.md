# Computer Architecture Book

Operating Systems Development requires knowledge of low level computer concepts
such as how CPUs, RAM, and IO devices work. The intermezzOS book touches on
these concepts only when learning about them is necessary to be able to build a
basic OS. The book doesn't linger too long on a specific subject, and only tries
to teach the reader "just enough" to help them understand the task at hand. But
if the reader wants to learn more, where should they go?

This is a proposal for a supplemental book on the topic of computers at the
lowest level. The book will try to teach the student the wide range of topics
associated with computer architecture that are essential for being able to
understand computers and operating systems on a deep level but aren't 100% necessary
for the task of actually building a basic OS.

These topics include:
  * Assembly Programming
  * Von Neumann Architecture
  * CPU Architecture and ISA
  * Stack and Heap memory
  * Virtual Memory
  * etc.

The book should not be thought of as a "learn to program assembly language"
tutorial. Instead, assembly will be used as a guide introducing the reader to new
topics and helping them "get their hands dirty".

## Drawbacks

The intermezzOS project already has one book. Adding another book adds more
responsibility for the community to handle. Because teaching readers about computers
on a low level and teaching them to build a basic OS have a lot in common,
material may overlap between the two books. The question of when one book
ends and the other begins may be difficult to answer.

## Alternatives

Of course, we can choose not write another book. Any topics that would have gone
into this book are instead covered in appendix chapters, covered as asides, addressed
through references to external blog posts or left out entirely. Those who are thirsty
for more will have to quench their thirst elsewhere.
